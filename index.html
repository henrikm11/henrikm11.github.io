			  <br>
			  <br>
				I am a mathematician and I used to work in Geometric Analysis. 
				More recently, I have been thinking about Generative AI, specifically Flow Matching and Diffusion Models.
				<br>
				My formal education consists of a PhD in mathematics which I obtained at MPIM Bonn supervised by <font size="+0.5"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Werner_Ballmann">Werner Ballmann</a> </font> with some time spent at MIT with <font size="+0.5"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Colding">Toby Colding.</a> </font>
				<br>
				After that I was an L.E. Dicksion Instructor at the University of Chicago with <font size="+0.5"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Neves"> Andr&eacute Neves.</a> </font>

				My work in Geometric Analysis is concerned with the Spectrum of the Laplace operator and Minimal Surfaces.
				Among others, my research has been published in

				<br>
				
				My research on generative AI is still in its earlier days.
				Right now it is focused on understanding and improving generative models based on insights from the regularity theory of differential equations.
				I have some papers in preparation that will hopefully be available very soon, please feel free to reach out if you want to know more or have a chat about these topics!

				<font size="+1.5"> <u> Teaching </u> </font>
				<br>
				<br>
				I was a TA and then an instructor from 2012-2022 at the University of Bonn and the University of Chicago for mathematics courses.
				I taught classes in Real and Complex Analysis, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Differential Geometry, and Algebraic Topology.
